# DataStructure_HashTable

雜湊表的資料結構，也稱為字典或是 symbol table。

We have all used a dictionary. Dictionay-alike data are found in many apps and database mgmt apps. In computer science, we generally use the Symbol Table rather than Dictionary, we define symbol table as a set of name-attributes pairs. The characteristics of name & attrs vary according to the apps.

# Ops in a Symbol Table

1) check whether the name is in table or not

2) retrieve attribute of the name using getter

3) modify the attribute of the name using setter

4) insert a pair of new data (name: attributes)

5) delete a pair of existing data (name: attributes)
