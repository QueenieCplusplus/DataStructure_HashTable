# DataStructure_HashTable

雜湊表的資料結構，也稱為字典或是 symbol table。

We have all used a dictionary. Dictionay-alike data are found in many apps and database mgmt apps. In computer science, we generally use the Symbol Table rather than Dictionary, we define symbol table as a set of name-attributes pairs. The characteristics of name & attrs vary according to the apps.

# Ops in a Symbol Table

2) retrieve attribute of the name using getter

3) modify the attribute of the name using setter

4) insert a pair of new data (name: attributes)

5) delete a pair of existing data (name: attributes)
